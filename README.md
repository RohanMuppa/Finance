# MyPages
MyPages repository will store all my small projects during my web development journey. I set this as a public repository as Github requires me to do so to host Github Pages. 
## Accessing Pages
(People with access to the repository) There are many different branches, each for different projects. To change branches go to settings/pages and set the source branch to the desired project then wait for a minute and open this link `https://rohanmuppa.github.io/MyPages/`. 

The Github page for the main branch should be a page with the same explanation that is in `README.md`.
