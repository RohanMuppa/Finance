# Finance
Finance is a web project created as an assignment for week 9 of Harvard CS50. Once you register and log yourself in there will be 5 main sections.
### Index (default)
Index is the default route that is opened up once you log in. Index will show to you all the stocks that you own along with some details about it. Index also provides you with your current cash balance and your combined net worth.
### Quote
Quote allows you to search up the current value of a stock by entering it's ticker into the search box then pressing search.
### Buy
Buy allows you to buy your desired stocks. Enter the stock ticker and the amount of shares you want to buy then the transaction will proceed and your information will be updated in the SQL database. An error will occur if you cannot afford that many shares or if you enter an invalid stock ticker.
### Sell
Sell allows you to sell any shares of a stock that you own. Select the stock then enter the number of shares you would like to sell. An error will occur if you choose to sell more shares than you currently own.
### History
History will show to you all the previous transactions that you've made. The ticker symbol; number of shares; purchase price; total amount, in US dollars, spent during that
transaction; and the time of transaction in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) will all be displayed to you on the screen.
# Extras
This application was made with Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It uses IEX API to get the stocks values in real time and a SQL database to store users information, such as username, a hash of the password, the stocks they bought or sold and the transaction history among others.
