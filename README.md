# MyPages
MyPages repository will store all my small projects during my web development journey. In this repository you will see the many smaller projects that I've deemed to be less important as there is most likely an independent repository for bigger, more important projects. I set this as a public repository as Github requires me to do so to host Github Pages. Feel free to check out the projects and reach out to me.
## Accessing Pages
(People with access to the repository) There are many different branches, each for different projects. To change branches go to settings/pages and set the source branch to the desired project then wait for a minute and open this link `https://rohanmuppa.github.io/MyPages/`. 

The Github page for the main branch should be a page with the same explanation that is in `README.md`.
