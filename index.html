    <h1>MyPages</h1>
    <p>
        MyPages repository will store all my small projects during my web development journey.
        I set this as a public repository as Github requires me to do so to host Github Pages.
    </p>
    <h2>Accessing Pages</h2>
    <p>
        (People with access to the repository) There are many different branches, each for different projects. 
        To change branches go to settings/pages and set the source branch to the desired project then wait for a minute and open this link `https://rohanmuppa.github.io/MyPages/`.
        <br><br>
        The Github page for the main branch should be a page with the same explanation that is in `README.md`.
